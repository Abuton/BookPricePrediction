# Experimenting with my new PySpark Knowledge
### Book Price Prediction
A Machine Learning Competition hosted on MachineHAck

### Spsark ML pipeline
Built a Machine Learning Model to predict house price in United State. Data was gotten from Kaggle

I tried to Automate the process of deploying the model by packaging the model building process into a pipeline that can be easily used by data scientist or decision makers to get insights into what the data is saying.

Still Developing and hoping to keep improving cheers.. :joy:

Been a while since i write codes in Pyspark Def gonna try something during the weekend
